This demo keeps growing, it started as a simple idea: "How can you create Node.Js back-ends using Typescript?"  The answer is: NestJS.   Along the way, I realized that the preferred way to develop back-ends is to do it locally on whatever your OS of choice is.  I running at the time of this writting a mess of OSes including : MacOS Mojava 10.14.2, Windows 10 Pro, Linux Ubuntu 16.04, 17.10 and 18.04. I need a way to develop equally as well on all my platforms.

My "must have" features are:

* 100% containerized - I install NOTHING locally.
* Ultra fast container reconfiguration
* Interactive Debugging
* Live Code Watching and rebuilds
* Emmet -- bow thy head to the awesome power of Emmet ---
* Linting
* Code completion
* Preffered IDE is Visual Code Studio
* Choice of using any database on this list: MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle, mongodb
* Choice of using redis
* Support ES6, ES7, ES8
* Support TypeScript (Obviously the entire point of this exercise)
* Include a test email server
* Browser based SQL Database Manager - I install NOTHING.
* Browser based Mongo Database Manager - I install NOTHING.
* SSL https for testing
* Domain Name aliasing for testing
* Unit tests

I tried Vagrant and Virtual Box but quickly rejected it because it forced me to rebuild my images from scratch every time.  I adopted Docker and Docker Compose as a way to quickly build up a fully containerized developmnet environment.  Once I started down the Docker path, setting up a fully featured development envrionment became so easy that I was able include features I hold only dreamed about.

Make no mistake: Docker is the greatest thing to ever haoppen to software development.

## Running

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

## Standard JavaScript Node.js 

The following describes the a node.js server project written in JavaScript.

### Nodemon 

12/13/2018 - I had to add a nodemon.json configuration in order to get nodemon working. It was then that I also realized that the node_modules folder can be either in the image or shared using a volume.  This is somewhat surprising to me because it changes the way I think about npm install and containers in general.  Running 'npm install' in a Dockerfile against a volume, in effect is the same as running 'npm install' on the local machine.  What I did was change my volume to point to the 'src' folder under simple-nodejs-server.

nodemon.json:
```
{
    "restartable": "rs",
    "verbose": true,
    "delay": "500ms",
    "watch": [
      "src/",
      "node_modules/"
    ],
    "ext": "js",
    "args": [
      "--inspect=9229"
    ]
  }
```

### Step debugging in MS Code Studio

Start node with debugging turned on

* --inspect tells Node that we want to run our app in debug mode.
* by adding -brk we also make sure that the app stops at the first line, so we have enough time to open up the inspector
* nadding =0.0.0.0 opens up the debugger to connections from any IP.

```
node --inspect-brk=0.0.0.0
```

In MS Code Studio, add a debug configuration:
```
{
  "name": "Docker: Attach to Node",
  "type": "node",
  "request": "attach",
  "port": 9229,
  "address": "localhost",
  "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
  "remoteRoot": "/",
  "protocol": "inspector"
}
```

## Terminal for simple-nodejs-server

```
docker-compose exec simple-nodejs-server bash
```

## Testing

### Phase 1

To see that all the various components are running, execute curl at the command line. If all the server respond, moveteh next next phase.

Main HTML/PHP Website
```
curl -i localhost:80
```

MailDev Website
```
curl -i localhost:1080
```

Adminer Website
```
curl -i localhost:8080
```

Simple Node.Js Server
```
curl -i localhost:4300
```

### Phase 2

* Test mysql at the command line
```
docker-compose exec db /bin/bash
```

* This command will run the mysql client and return the version of the currently running server.
```
docker exec -i mysql-c mysql -uroot -pmysql  <<< "select version();"
```

* dump the mysql database without having to use a password
  * gzipped
```
docker-compose exec db mysqldump nestdemo | gzip > db/backups/nestdemo.sql.gz
```
  * plain
```
docker-compose exec db mysqldump nestdemo | cat > db/backups/nestdemo.sql
```


## Steps to Create this ProjectSetup

Dependencies

```
    npm init
    npm i typescript -g
    npm i typescript --save-dev
    tsc --init or ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --init
```

Letâ€™s add just two more options to that base configuration tsconfig.json:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true
  }
}
```
## Docker

The dockedr-compose environment includes :

* mysql
  * [mysql](https://docs.docker.com/samples/library/mysql/#-via-docker-stack-deploy-or-docker-compose)
* adminer
  * [Adminer](https://hub.docker.com/_/adminer/)
  * ![Adminer](./docs/adminer.png)
* Maildev Client
  * For sending email
  * ![maildev](./docs/maildev.png)
* nginx
* php-fpm

## To Cleanup

* Stop all containers
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```
* Delete all containers
```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```
* Delete all images
```
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```
* Delete all volumes
```
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```

* All commands together to make easier cut-n-paste
```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
